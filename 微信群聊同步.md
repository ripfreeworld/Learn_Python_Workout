## Exercise 1: 

Write a program that chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.

Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of:

Too high; Too low; Just right

If the user guessed correctly, then the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.

The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.

Note:
If the user simply presses Enter when presented with the input prompt, the value returned by input is an empty string, not None. Indeed, the return value from input will always be a string, regardless of what the user entered.

### Update the Exercise 1:

1. Modify this program, such that it gives the user only 3 chances to guess the correct number. If they try three times without success, they’re told that they didn’t guess in time, and the program exits.

~~2. Not only should you choose a random number, but you should also choose a random number base, from 2 to 16, in which the user should submit their input. If the user inputs "10" as their guess, you’ll need to interpret it in the correct number base; "10" might mean 10 (decimal) or 2 (binary) or 16 (hexadecimal).~~ (个人觉得比较麻烦，用处不大)

3. Try the same thing, but have the program choose a random word from the dictionary, and then ask the user to guess the word. (You might want to limit yourself to words containing between 2-5 letters, to avoid making it too horribly diffciult.) Instead of telling the user that they should guess a smaller or larger number, have them choose an earlier or later word in the dictionary.


## Exercise 2:
*re-implementing functionality*

The function takes a sequence of numbers, and returns the sum of those numbers. So if you were to invoke sum([1,2,3]), the result would be 6.

The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as the built-in sum function. However, instead of taking a single sequence as a parameter, it should take a variable number of arguments. Thus while we might invoke sum([1,2,3]), we would instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or mysum(10,20,30,40,50).

(The built-in sum function takes an optional second argument, which we’re ignoring here.)
Never use the built-in sum function to accomplish this!

(And in particular, you should think about the types of parameters functions can take in Python. In many languages, functions can be defined multiple times, each with a different type signature (i.e., number of parameters, and parameter types). In Python, only one function definition (i.e., the last time that the function was defined) sticks. The flexibility comes from appropriate use of the different parameter types.)

## Exercise 3:
A Student class:
    • Variables
    • Name
    • Matriculation Number
    • Courses he is registered to
    • Methods
      • To print all the information of the student
      • To add a course he is registered to.
      • Method to add a grade to the registered course
      • Should check if he is registered to that course, if not should complain.
      • If yes it should add a grade for that particular course
       (Think of Dictionaries)
       
Add 3 Students (objects of the student class) to a list. 
(of course with all the data filled in)


## Exercise 4: 
*Pig Latin*

Pig Latin is a common children’s „secret“ language in English-speaking countries. 

The rules for translating words from English into Pig Latin are quite simple:

If the word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), then add way to the end of the word. So air becomes airway and eat becomes eatway.

If the word begins with any other letter, then we take the first letter, put it on the end of the word, and then add ay. Thus, python becomes ythonpay and computer becomes omputercay.

For this exercise, write a Python program that asks the user to enter an English word. Your program should then print the word, translated into Pig Latin. You may assume the the word contains no capital letters or punctuation.


## Exercise 5:
*Flip a dictionary*

KEY WORDS: #dictionary #comprehension<br><br>
Flip a dictionary — that is, to exchange its keys and values. Imagine a dict in which the keys are usernames and the values are user ID numbers; it might be useful to flip that, so that you can search by ID number.<br>
To do this exercise, first create a dictionary of any size, in which the keys are unique and the values are also unique.
