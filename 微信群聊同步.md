Exercise 1:

Write a program that chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive). Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.

Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of:

Too high; Too low; Just right

If the user guessed correctly, then the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.

The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.

Note:
If the user simply presses Enter when presented with the input prompt, the value returned by input is an empty string, not None. Indeed, the return value from input will always be a string, regardless of what the user entered.
